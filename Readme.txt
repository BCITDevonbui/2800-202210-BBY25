This assignment is [95]% complete.

We were unable to complete properly rendering items in the cart page. The cards are dynamically created and output the correct number of cards in relation to the items put in by the user. We struggled with having promises to wait for each item data to be pull and put into the card before the card gets put into the page. This is why the cart history shows the package with the item IDs, but the cards in the cart page have undefined as the details.
